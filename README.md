# gba-song-assembler
A rewrite of [Sappy2006's assembler](https://github.com/Touched/Sappy/blob/master/source/frmAssembler.frm) into Python. Assembles MP2K song s files into binary and injects them into a GBA game.

**Please make a backup of your GBA rom file before modifying it with this program.**

On Windows, I recommend running this with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) Command Prompt.
